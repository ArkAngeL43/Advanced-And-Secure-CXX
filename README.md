# About this tutorial 

This tutorial was a secondary write up i plan on doing about the C++ programming language. This tutorial will teach the basics to advanced C++ code from using simple variables to data types and using OOP concepts in C++ with the use of public private and friend classes. It will start off like any other introduction where i introduce who i am currently and what my focus of the article is then go into the basics of both security in applications and development as well as the basics of the C++ programming language, NOTE THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR C++ VERSION 20. This tutorial will teach you basic concepts of security as well as making things like encryption scripts, brute forcers, file crawlers, system loaders, authentication systems, key generators, and packet parsers and maybe even IDS's ( Intrusion Detection Systems ). 

The plan for this tutorial is to act again like any other one, it will talk about code bricks and describe them as you move on and on in the project. 


# Whoami 

my name is RE43P3R i am intermediate in cyber security, a game cheat developer, systems / security and authentication systems developer, as well as a legacy developer on my own time. I have had experience in multiple languages those which include 

Language Name  | 
-------------  | 
Fortran95      | 
Fortran77      | 
Fortran2003    |
Perl 3-5       | 
Some RAKU      | 
Ruby           | 
C++            | 
Go             | 

and others that i have yet to do write ups on, if you have not seen my other write ups i have multiple on multiple programming languages currently 

C++, Go, Perl, and general fortran and math
