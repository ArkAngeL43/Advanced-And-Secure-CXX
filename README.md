# About this tutorial 

This tutorial was a secondary write up i plan on doing about the C++ programming language. This tutorial will teach the basics to advanced C++ code from using simple variables to data types and using OOP concepts in C++ with the use of public private and friend classes. It will start off like any other introduction where i introduce who i am currently and what my focus of the article is then go into the basics of both security in applications and development as well as the basics of the C++ programming language, NOTE THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR C++ VERSION 20. This tutorial will teach you basic concepts of security as well as making things like encryption scripts, brute forcers, file crawlers, system loaders, authentication systems, key generators, and packet parsers and maybe even IDS's ( Intrusion Detection Systems ). 

The plan for this tutorial is to act again like any other one, it will talk about code bricks and describe them as you move on and on in the project. 


# Whoami 

my name is RE43P3R i am intermediate in cyber security, a game cheat developer, systems / security and authentication systems developer, as well as a legacy developer on my own time. I have had experience in multiple languages those which include 

Language Name  | 
-------------  | 
Fortran95      | 
Fortran77      | 
Fortran2003    |
Perl 3-5       | 
Some RAKU      | 
Ruby           | 
C++            | 
Go             | 

and others that i have yet to do write ups on, if you have not seen my other write ups i have multiple on multiple programming languages currently 

C++, Go, Perl, and general fortran and math

# Credits and reasons for this tutorial 

Recently i have just gotten a job for Authentication and systems development for a small group of people, and the code and backend of the system will be written in C++20, i have not used C++ at all in a long time which is what prompted the article, at the time of writing this i have so far spent about 4 months in the C++ programming language since a year ago and it has definitely changed alot. i want to thank the writer of the `eighth edition of C++14 and C++17 Coverage Sams teahc yourself C++ in one hour a day` despite us being in C++20 now this book has helped me alot through the proces sof writing this understanding new ways to use and write C++, the very basics of C++ but with a tad touch to it. I highly suggest if you are new to C++ you read that book, it is 700+ pages of pure amazing C++ again if your reading this adn using C++20 it might not be worth the time but it still teaches concepts used in C++.
